"""Pre-trained NLU optimizations for Soni framework.

This package contains optimized NLU modules that ship with the framework
to provide reasonable out-of-the-box performance.

Baseline Optimization
---------------------
The baseline_v1.json module is automatically loaded by SoniDU() to provide
immediate functionality without requiring custom training.

Custom Optimizations
--------------------
Projects can create and load custom optimizations for domain-specific performance.

See README.md for details.
